            In the crypto space, an account that holds a large amount of bitcoin
            or other cryptocurrency is known as a whale. This app allows a user
            to view blockchain whale account transactions that exceed $500,000.
            This is possible because the transaction details of the listed
            cryptocurrencies are publicly available.
